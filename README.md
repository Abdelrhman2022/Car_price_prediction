# Car price prediction
Car price prediction has been a high-interest research area, as it requires noticeable effort and knowledge of the field expert. Considerable numbers of distinct attributes are examined for reliable and accurate prediction. The data used for the prediction was collected from the **kaggle**


In this project, I'll build a model for predicting the price of cars, by applying several machine learning techniques. The respective performances of different algorithms were then compared to find one that best suits the available data set.
